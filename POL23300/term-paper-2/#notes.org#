* Term paper plan

** Overview
The idea is to write a paper on the indirect effects of the climate regime in the US.

*** Assumptions / Setting the scene
- The international climate regime has not been particluarly effective
- Lots of failed/disappointing conferences Rio, Copenhagen, Chile/Madrid
- Mismatch between what the scientific consensus says is required and what actors actually do
  - Agents are doing a heavy shirk of their responsibility


** Mechanism
- Stepwise process of sub-national actors building support and policy frameworks
- Polycentric governance
  - Multi-faceted wicked problem means action required on all levels
  - Big/International companies have a big impact
  - Theories about certification/private regulation

** Outcomes
Stepwise process
- State level and city level action
- Not seeing vertical policy diffusion
- But are seeing horizontal policy diffusion, a bit
  - Therefore race to the top for (some) cities + states

Polycentric governance
- Private regulation is starting to happen
- More companies
- Lots of laggards who don't care about climate

** Sections

*** Introduction
- Set the scene, explain what I want to do with the paper
- Explain the urgency of climate change
- ... and the lack of action from the international climate regime (cite https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/1/8/5610806)
- Explain that the paper will look at secondary effects of the international climate regime inside of the US
- Efforts to change society in light of climate change despite a percieved failure of the international regime and a disinterested federal government
- Will look at two areas
  - State level action (cities not included)
  - Corperate action

*** Theoretical framework + methodology
- Aims to use a polycentric governance approach to analyse both cases;
  unit of analysis will be a subnational actor with agency to make
  climate related decisions.
- Systematic review of papers and reports aiming to find evidence that this is the case

(From 'A polycentric approach to climate governance')
- I will identify the hallmarks of Polycentric governance as characterised by Dorsch and Flashland:
  - Self organization             <- Evident from the explicit lack of state/regime involvement
  - Site-specific conditions      <- Specific to each state or country
  - Experimentation and learning  <- Policy innovation and diffusion
  - Trust                         <- Private regulation increases trust

*** Empirical analysis
