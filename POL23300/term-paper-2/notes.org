* Term paper plan

** Overview
The idea is to write a paper on the indirect effects of the climate regime in the US.

*** Assumptions / Setting the scene
- The international climate regime has not been particluarly effective
- Lots of failed/disappointing conferences Rio, Copenhagen, Chile/Madrid
- Mismatch between what the scientific consensus says is required and what actors actually do
  - Agents are doing a heavy shirk of their responsibility


** Mechanism
- Stepwise process of sub-national actors building support and policy frameworks
- Polycentric governance
  - Multi-faceted wicked problem means action required on all levels
  - Big/International companies have a big impact
  - Theories about certification/private regulation

** Outcomes
Stepwise process
- State level and city level action
- Not seeing vertical policy diffusion
- But are seeing horizontal policy diffusion, a bit
  - Therefore race to the top for (some) cities + states

Polycentric governance
- Private regulation is starting to happen
- More companies
- Lots of laggards who don't care about climate

- Efforts to change society in light of climate change despite a percieved failure of the international regime and a disinterested federal government
