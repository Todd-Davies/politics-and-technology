Change (UNFCCC), which has just come to a close in Bonn, was expected to be the first
global climate conference in which the absence of US leadership would be felt. Donald
Trump?s electoral victory a year ago coincided with the previous COP22 in Marrakech,
immediately souring the mood among the delegates, who had started the conference by
celebrating the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement just days before.1}
