\section{Conclusions}

This literature review has outlined seven distinct tactics used to wage hybrid
warfare and outlined examples of each. The review shows the breadth of possible
threats involved when actors utilize the tactics of hybrid warfare, and as such,
underscores the breadth of the response required to effectively counter a hybrid
adversary.

Further research is warranted to review possible counter measures that can be
deployed against each of the above techniques. Surveying the broad landscape of
hybrid tactics was prioritized over a deeper analysis of individual methods in
this review, but further work could outline the suitability of each tactic
listed above for use in different settings and against different adversaries.
