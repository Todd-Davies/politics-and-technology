- Part of week 1 of #POL61305 by [[Maria Stern]]. and [[Joakim Ojendal]]
- Introduction
    - Development and security are linked, since a more secure world is only possible if poor countries are given a real chance to develop.
    - Wars kill development as well as people, and are made more likely by infectious disease and poverty.
    - The 'security-development' nexus is now accepted and growing in importance.
    - The authors are worried about development issues being classed as security issues and then made very (unduly) important/actionable ([[securitized]]).
- The Security-Development Nexus: What is a Nexus Anyway?
    - A nexus can be understood as a network of connections between disparate ideas, processor or objects; alluding to a nexus implies an infinite number of possible linkages and relations.
- Stories About Development
    - Development as a Modern Teleological Narrative
        - Development has been understood as a process of biological evolution, signifying the ultimate fulfilling of the processo fbecomeing what one is 'supposed to be'.
        - Belief in modernization through development was seen as a  quick route away from underdevelopment, following the path forged by Europe.
        - Elites and politicians were the main benefactors, and 'trickle down' was  what was hoped for the rest
    - Broadening, Deepening and Humanizing Development
        - One set of thinkers rebutted the modern narrative above saying that capitalism necessarily kept third world countries under-developed, and that third world countries should try to unlink themselves from the West.
        - The other rebuttal came from those who thought that the smallest, poorest producers should come first to include as many in the upwards rise of technology as possible. This is 'human' development as opposed to state development.
    - Development as Impasse
        - Some thought that development failed to alleviate poverty in the third world, and examination of first world countries showed that it wasn't even that desirable anyway. Hence, that the state was overbelieved in, especially in the wake of globalization.
    - Post-Development
        - Says that development reproduced colonial attitudes and power relations. It said development disempowered people and disrupted local power relations, creating conflict.
    - Development as a Technique of Governmentality
        - Called for more regulation and stronger institutions, as well on bolstering failed states.
        - This approach looks at regulation, and examines the violence and marginalization it can entail.
    - Globalized Development
        - Globalization challenged the traditional idea of development, both in terms of global governance and also in trying to embrace a fair and environmentally sustainable supply chain.
        - It says that state-level attempts to regulate the global economy don't work well, though migration, trade, aid flows and foreign investment work well to keep the systme going.
- Stories about Security
    - Security as Modern (Teleological Narrative)
        - Global politics is supposed to be about state security, how it is procured and maintained.
        - The state is seen as the foundation of good in society
        - 'Security' has evolved around the modern notion of sovereignty. I.e. the state must be secure, otherwise society unravels and people are put in danger.
        - Ensuring state survival trumps other politics, and security measures must be constantly increased, allowing good society to flourish.
        - Security is seen as a good thing, and should be maximised (even in other sectors, such as the economy and the environment).
    - Broadening, Deepening and Humanizing Security
        - Lots of academic conversation about security has been about widening its definition.
        - There is a consensus that nation states (and the nation state system) lack the capacity to deal with new security threats such as terrorism.
        - Security is moving away from being a public good provided by the state
    - Security as Impossible
        - Security measures often create ripples of violence and fear, producing more insecurity.
        - Security measures increase fear and a sense of impending fanger.
    - Post-Security
        - People say that we should desecuritize as opposed to securitize, since 'security' measures produce a state of insecurity.
    - Security as a Technique of Governmentality
        - Security involves suppression, policing, surveillance, regulation, violence, etc.
        - Security practices serve as ways to suppress challenges to the existing neoliberal order.
    - Globalized Security
        - The globe is seen as the appropriate level at which to speak about security.
        - This helps frame climate change (which is global in scope) as a security concern.
- Mapping 'The Nexus'
    - This section tries to mesh the above 'stories' together
    - The Security-Development Nexus as Modern Teleological Narrative
        - The promise of security depends on a successful march towards progress and modernity, and the forms of modern life that adhere to that trajectory.
        - Security and development reinforce each other, but neither is truly attainable and the duality doesn't work.
    - Security-Development Nexus: Deepened, Broadened, Humanized
        - -
    - Security-Development Nexus as Impass/Impossible
        - -
    - Post-Security-Development
        - -
    - Security-Development as Technique of Governmentality
        - -
    - Globalized Security-Development
        - -
- Ridiculous and Representative? Stories Aplenty
    - It's hard to create a single narrative. Most policy papers use multiple angles of analysis that are contradictory.
    - There is a prevailing view that if underdeveloped countries are helped, then they won't be breeding grounds for insecurity, and richer countries will become more secure.
- Conclusion: The Significance of Identifying 'The Nexus(es)'
    - "The above cursory reading does no leave us much wiser as to what 'the nexus' is, should be, or does" - TOO RIGHT
    - There are many ways to show how security and development interact.
