- Week 1 of the #POL61305 course, by [[Emma Rothschild]].
- Describes the self concious principles of the 1990's, and their possible political consequences. 
- They are similar to the liberal ideas of the early 18th century, including from a security point of view.
- Extended Security
    - 'Security' in the 1990's was extended in four ways:
        - From the security of nations to the security of groups and individuals
        - From the security of nations to the security of the international system and the security of the supranational physical environment; from the nation to the biosphere
        - Horizontally, from military security to political, economic, social, environmental or 'human' security
        - The political responsibility of ensuring security is extended from the nation state; it is diffused upwards to international institutions, downwards to regional and local governments, and sideways to NGOs/public opinion/the press/etc.
    - Lots of reports came out to this effect around that time outlining new conceptions:
        - Military security was seen as a means, while economic, political and social security were seen as ends in themselves.
        - The nuclear and conventional arms problems were reflections of weaknesses in the international system, lacking the structure of laws and behavioural norms that are accepted and observed by all states.
        - Security is a process as much as a condition, where individuals, groups, governments and states are all involved.
    - During and after the cold war, there was a shift in emphasis from the rights and well-being of the national group to the rights and well-being of the individual person. International Organizations gained in importance in organising this.
- Principles of Security
    - Purposes of setting out principles and definitions of security:
        - To provide guidance to governments on policy issues
        - To guide public opinion on the principles of security policy
        - To contest existing policies; disputing their foundations to subvert their public support.
            - If the sources of insecurity changed with the cold war ending, then the security forces must change in order to maintain security. We must define security well so they can properly aim for it.
        - To influence the distribution of money and power.
            - E.g. environmental organizations emphasizing environmental security to move money towards ministries of commerce and away from ministries of war, or changing the definition of military security to include the prevention of conflicts could increase the number of peace keeping forces.
- What is Security?
    - Many historical writers understood security as applying to the individual (this is a massively dumbed down version of p 60/61).
    - Later on (18th century++), the idea of social security manifested, aiming to make as many families 'secure' as possible. Freedom from fear of destitution so that people can freely participate in societal/political life.
    - Lots of historical context in this section that I didn't bother making notes on.
- International security
    - Again, a fairly obtuse recount of history.
- Extended Security and Extended Policies
    - More inclusiveness (i.e. actors) in security means more complexity.
    - Incoherence:
        - Individual - there are so many people to keep secure, you can't consider them all. E.g. people in far away states
        - Political - security is an objective of individuals, but can only be achieved in a collective or political process.
    - Having a right doesn't mean much if you don't know you have the right, or don't understand it.
        - If you're troubled by violence, but don't know who can help you, then you're stuck.
    - Since 1991, the principle of 'intervention' has been around
        - The idea is that a country projects force into another country to intervene in the early stages of a crisis, and make it less bad. This is a deterrence.
        - It's not the same as prevention, which is harder to get a consensus on because the threat is immaterial at the time that the consensus is made.
        - It's much easier to intervene in the very early stages of a conflict, but much harder to get international consensus on doing so.
    - Nonmilitary policies:
        - Recognizing a new sovereign (or government), conditional on guarantees on individual rights
        - Building schools that are multilingual as in Singapore
        - Be careful not to reward countries where moral hazards appear to be at risk
    - The promise of the end of the Cold War has never been understood; the promise of a world of peaceful political competition.
    - There has been little effort to stem the production of conventional arms in the post cold war period
- Civil society strategies
    - NGO's and companies are playing a larger role in security related stuff
        - Airlines are delivering humanitarian aid, and are competing with public agencies for funding to do so
        - NGO's negotiate cease fires and hostage exchanges
    - This development allows material support from private foundations, and provides a space for global governance for civil society distinct from governments
    - NGO's cannot provide security, because security is tied into law, and NGO's are not part of government. (Not sure if I understood that correctly, top of p80).
    - News media, both dependent on and independent constitute the core of civil society, and play a central role in the frightening process where very large numbers of people get either very excited or very scared, which pushes nations towards war.
    - NGO's have no obligation, and therefore their services are voluntary. Their services are therefore of goodwill rather than contract.
        - This makes recipients more insecure, since they are often dependent on the voluntary service, which could be taken away. This undermines the effectiveness of the programme
        - [[Adam Smith]] said that only a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens.
- Free and equal discussion
    - Liberalism has only one overriding aim: to secure the political conditions that are necessary for the exercise of personal freedom.
    - The politics of individual security are in that sense very liberal
    - [[John Stuart Mill]] said argued for dispersion of power towards lower levels of government "the greatest dissemination of power consistent with efficiency".
    - Now information is increased, distant horrors such as wars gain public attention, but at the same time, the power of distant countries also appears greater. What's the effect on the propensity for the public to support intervention?
    - [[Emma Rothschild]] argues for international authorities with the power to enforce laws.
    - Page 88 talks about the stoic idea of concentric circles of identity, with the innermost ones being the ones most strongly identified ones (e.g. family), and the outermost being weaker (e.g. international order)
