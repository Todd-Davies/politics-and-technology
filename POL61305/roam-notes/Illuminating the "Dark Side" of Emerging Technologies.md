- From week 2 of [[POL61305]], by [[Aharon Hauptman]]
- Introduction
    - Foresight studies help us consider alternative futures in order to increase the prospect of making informed decisions leading to a desirable future.
    - Every new technology can have a good side and a dark side.
    - The paper focuses on security and privacy threats, concentrating on abuse scenarios in a security context, and intrusions and changes to perception in a privacy context.
- Emerging technologies and security threats
    - FESTOS is a project to consider emerging security threats from the European Union. 280 experts were involved, and rated 33 technologies. The scales were:
        - Maturity timeframe (e.g. before 2020, before 2030, after that)
        - Abuse potential, made up of the 'severity of the threat' multiplied by the 'easiness of abuse'
        - Likelihood to actually pose a security threat in the future
    - Three broad categories of threats were observed:
        - Disruption of certain applications, such as cyberattacks.
        - Increased accessibility to technologies that were once hard to get to (such as gene sequencing)
        - Suprising malicious uses of new technology.
            - [[Note]] Old technology that has survived and has the [[Lindy Effect]] apply to it is less likely to 'mutate' in these ways than a new technology. Thus, old tech is in some societal sense, safer on a societal level.
    - 'Wild cards' are low-probability but high-impact events.
    - The majority of the experts agreed that the public was badly informed about the dangers of new technologies, and that governments underestimate threats.
    - Organizations are especially vulnerable to wild cards, since they have a very high impact on specific systems and stakeholders. Foresight studies can help alleviate this vulnerability.
- Emerging technologies and privacy
    - Example of disruption & changing attitudes: the history of photography
        - In the 1800's, it was mostly used for private portraits of wealthy people in special studios.
        - The subject had full control and sharing was rare and always authorized
        - Tech progressed, and cameras were minified. Journalists took photos and for celebrities, it was the 'end of privacy'.
        - Now we have cameras everywhere, and social networks that encourage widespread sharing.
    - Nano technology (such as micro sensors that can pick up environmental traces of substances on people that can show where they've been) could lead to nano-panopticism.
    - ICT tech is the usual subject in privacy debates, but converging technologies produce lots of privacy issues too.
    - PRACTIS was a similar effort to FESTOS.
    - Three main types of privacy issues examined:
        - Threats to privacy - tech makes it easier for information to be gathered on people
        - Enhancements of privacy - innovations that could enable new privacy-enhancing technologies
        - Changing of perceptions - hard to attribute to a single technology, but people may get used to intrusive technologies, and no-longer consider new invasive tech to be a privacy threat.
    - There is often a trade off between privacy and concrete benefits such as improved security or lower healthcare costs.
    - Common expert opinions from PRACTIS:
        - The convergence of several technologies often had a high privacy impact
        - In modern society, absolute prevention of privacy intrusion is impossible due to a tradeoff between benefits and sacrificing privacy.
    - The complexity of new technologies and the convergence of multiple new technologies affects privacy in the sense that the data subjects will find it more difficult to figure out how these technologies process their data and whether the data is aggregated, matched with other subjects' data, transferred to third parties, etc.
    - Five scenarios for privacy in the future were created:
        - Privacy has faded away as people's perception changed to be less interested in privacy. They voluntarily sell their privacy for money or services.
        - People value privacy and want to protect it, using privacy enhancing technologies and legislation to enforce their use.
        - People value privacy, but have lost control of it. People are constantly monitored, and have sleepwalked into a no-privacy world.
        - Privacy has a market value, and only rich people can afford it. Tech companies create two versions of their products, one without privacy which is cheaper, and one with it which is more expensive. Tension between social classes increases.
        - Privacy is tailor made to each individual. Privacy enhancing technologies are widely available, and are applied selectively by people. The public are sufficiently educated to understand their use & importance.
- Conclusions
    - Every emerging technology may embody its dark side as well as its bright side.
    - The dark side of technology needs activities from decision makers to balance security needs with technology research.
    - Bottom up approaches involving code of conduct, ethical guidelines, self control, education of engineers and scientists, etc are going to be most useful.
    - Hopefully, national, continental and global regimes of these rules/ethics/organizations will appear.
    - R&D efforts should be aimed at security by design and privacy by design approaches.
