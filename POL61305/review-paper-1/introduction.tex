\section{Introduction}

5G is the fifth and latest generation of mobile phone technology, which is
currently being deployed worldwide. Unlike previous generations of mobile phone
technology, 5G adoption has been heavily
securitized~\cite{balzacq2016securitization} and controversial.

In the review, relevant papers were identified by searching Google Scholar using
the terms ``5G'', ``international security'', ``national security'', and by
searching for literature among prominent think tanks and international
organizations such as Chatham House, United Nations Institute for Disarmament
Research (UNDIR), Center for New American Security (CNAS), Center for Strategic
and International Studies (CSIS), German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP)
etc. Citations were then followed from the above sources in order to get a
comprehensive overview of the current literature on the security relevant
aspects of 5G.
