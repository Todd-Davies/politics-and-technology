\textit{5G is the next generation of mobile telecommunications technology. It
  represents a step change in what is possible with wireless networks, and will
  lead to a vastly increased number of use-cases that are embedded more deeply
  into the fabric of society than is currently the case. Potential uses include
  smart cities, self-driving cars, and internet of things devices.}

\textit{While this has the potential to unlock huge economic growth, it also makes
  mobile networks a critical dependency of a modern economy and as such, control
  over the development and implementation of 5G technology has been heavily
  securitized.}

\textit{This paper constitutes a narrative literature review of the security
  aspects of 5G, and as such, aims to outline the different views, approaches,
  theories and models used by various scholars and real-world actors. This
  includes a description of different models of technological development that
  are used to conceptualize 5G, realist and neoliberal views of how 5G affects
  the world order, and finally, a description of conspiracy theories around 5G.}
