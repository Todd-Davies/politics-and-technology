\card{
  Science
}{
  Is the systematic and organized body of knowledge in any area of inquiry that is acquired using the ``scientific method''.
}
\card{
  Natural Sciences
}{
  Are the sciences of naturally occurring objects or phenomena, such as light, objects, matter, earth, etc. Natural Sciences can be further broken down into physical sciences, earth sciences, life science, etc.
}
\card{
  Social Sciences
}{
  Are the sciences of people or collections of people (such as groups, firms, economies, societies) and their behaviours. These sciences include psychology, sociology and economics.
}
\card{
  (Scientific) Laws
}{
  Are observed patterns of phenomena or behaviour.
}
\card{
  (Scientific) Theories
}{
  Are systematic explanations of the underlying phenomenon or behaviour.
}
\card{
  Inductive Research (theory building)
}{
  Involves the researcher inferring theoretical concepts and patterns from observed data.
}
\card{
  Deductive Research (theory testing)
}{
  Involves the researcher testing concepts and patterns from a known theory using new empirical data.
}
\card{
  Unit of analysis
}{
  Refers to the person, collective, or object that is the target of the investigation.
}
\card{
  Concepts
}{
  Are generalizable properties or characteristics associated with objects, events or people.
}
\card{
  Construct
}{
  A construct is an abstract concept that is specifically chosen (or created) to explain a given phenomenon. Constructs can be unidimensional such as somebody's weight, or multidimensional such as somebody's communication skills.
}
\card{
  Operational definitions
}{
  Are used for scientific research (in place of dictionary definitions), and define constructs in terms of how they will be empirically measured. For example, the operational definition of temperature will explain what unit it will be measured in.
}
\card{
  Variable
}{
  A variable is a measurable representation of an abstract construct.
}
\card{
  Normological Network
}{
  The overall network of relationships between a set of related constructs.
}
\card{
  Proposition
}{
  A tentative and conjectural relationship between constructs that is stated in a declarative form. E.g. ``An increase in student intelligence causes an increase in their academic achievement''. It does not have to be true, but does have to be empirically testable using data.
}
\card{
  Hypothesis
}{
  A hypothesis is the empirical version of a proposition, that is to say that it says something about the relationship between variables, with the dependent and independent variables clearly specified.
}
\card{
  Strong Hypothesis
}{
  Is a hypothesis with its directionality and causality specified (as opposed to a weak hypothesis, which specifies neither).
}
\card{
  Theory
}{
  A theory is a set of systematically interrelated constructs and propositions intended to explain and predict a phenomenon or behaviour of interest, within certain boundary conditions and assumptions.
}
\card{
  Model
}{
  A model is a representation of all or part of a system that is constructed to study that system. While a theory tries to explain a phenomenon, a model tries to represent a phenomenon.
}
\card{
  Paradigm
}{
  A paradigm is a mental model or frame of reference that we use to organize our reasoning and observations. They are often hard to recognize because they are implicit, assumed and taken for granted.
}
\card{
  Positivism
}{
  Says that knowledge creation is restructured to what can be observed and measured, tending towards theories that can be directly tested (and positively confirmed).
}
\card{

}
\card{
  Nomothetic explanations
}{
  Are explanations that seek to explain a class of situations or events rather than a specific situation or event. E.g. generally, students can fail exams because they don't spend enough time studying. They are less precise and less complete than idiographic explanations, but are also economical in their explanations and use few variables. Theories are usually nomothetic.
}

}{
  States that among competing explanations that sufficiently explain the observed evidence, the most simple theory is usually the best.
}
\card{
  Grounded theory building
}{
  Is building theories based on observed patterns of events or behaviours. The theory is `grounded' in empirical observations. The researcher must provide a consistent explanation for all the patterns.
}
\card{
  Internal Validity
}{
  Examines whether the observed change in a dependent variable is indeed caused by a corresponding change in the independent variable, and not by other variables. Internal validity requires that the effect happens if the cause happens (covariation), the cause must precede the effect (temporal precedence) and that there is no plausible alternative explanation.
}
\card{
  External Validity
}{
  Refers to whether the observed associations can be generalized from the sample to the population.
}
\card{
  Construct Validity
}{
  Examines how well a given measurement scale is measuring the theoretical construct that it is expected to measure. E.g. if empathy is being measured, it must be asserted that it's not actually compassion being measured.
}
\card{
  Statistical Conclusion Validity
}{
  Examines the extend that conclusions derived using a statistical procedure are valid.
}
\card{
  Conceptualization
}{
  Is the process by which fuzzy and imprecise constructs (concepts) are defined in concrete and precise terms.

}
\card{
  Rating scales
}{
  Refer to the values that an indicator can take (kind of like the type of a variable in a programming language.
